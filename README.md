Description: Familiarizes with the Processing GUI and designing software for microcontroller Arduino Mega 2650.
The game is divided into 2 blocks, a program that is responsible for drawing the graphical interface (IG), and another
Arduino program that, using the MQTT protocol, simulates the behavior of 3 nodes of a embedded and distributed system
Communication using the MQTT protocol has been chosen. This Data is sent to the Broquer MQTT via the Internet to manage 
message traffic and respond to the nodes subscribed to the “topics”.

To carry out the project, use has been made of: an Arduino Mega board, an Ethernet Shield,
an LCD screen, a 5x4 matrix keyboard (with 8 LEDs), two potentiometers, cables, a cable that
allows serial communication with the computer, a router and an ethernet cable to connect the
arduino with the router.


==============================================================
              ## How to run this projec  ##
==============================================================
Dump the Arduino code onto the microcontroller with external hardware connected and run the processing code file on your HOST machine with the processing program. Connect your Arduino Mega 2650 to a router to permit the MQTT comunication between players and the Broker. You are ready to play.
